The first step of the screening process is called abstract screening.  Systematic review searches can yield thousands of citations, so it is unreasonable to read the full text of every single potentially relevant article.  By first reading only the abstracts, you can substantially reduce the number of full-text articles you have to retrieve and read later on in the screening process.<br><br>

To get started, assemble a team of screeners. To avoid accidentally screening out a relevant article, and to save time, you’ll want to be sure you’re not doing this step all alone.
<br><br>
Abstract screening typically begins with a “pilot round,” where all reviewers screen the same 100 or so abstracts.  This helps you and your team refine your criteria for what kinds of articles should and shouldn’t be included. We call this your inclusion/exclusion criteria.
<br><br>
The pilot stage also helps all of your screeners get on the same page. You use this time to make sure everyone has the same interpretation of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  After one or more pilot rounds (however many it takes for your screeners to make consistent decisions about which articles stay and which articles go), you’ll divide the abstracts among your team, making sure two reviewers read each abstract. 
<br><br>
We call this “screening in duplicate.”  This is a quality control measure to reduce human error.  If the screeners disagree about an article, use a third team member as a tie-breaker or discuss that abstract as a group. Remember, at this stage it is best to err on the side of keeping articles you aren’t sure about until you get the full text and have more information.
<br><br>
Journals often limit the word count of abstracts.  Because of this, researchers often fail to mention some of the outcomes that are assessed in their study.  That’s why it’s a good idea to screen abstracts using only the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Design elements of your PICO (D) question. If you screen abstracts using your Outcomes, it’s likely you’ll miss some important research. In any case, at this stage it is better to include irrelevant abstracts than reject relevant ones. 
<br><br>
Once you’ve done this quick review of all of your abstracts, it’s wise to use what you’ve learned from this step to refine your exclusion and inclusion criteria for full-text articles. We’ll talk about that on the next page.

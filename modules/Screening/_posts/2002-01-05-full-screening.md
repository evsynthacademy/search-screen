## Full-Text Screening

Once you’ve decided which abstracts meet your eligibility criteria, you’ll want to find the full-text documents for one last screen of the studies. 

You usually conduct full-text screening at the same time you’re extracting your data, which is the next course in our series. 

Just remember to read the full text of an article before you extract the data. If you find a study that should be rejected at this stage, write down the rejection reason. You’ll want to include this information in your final report. 

Congratulations! You now know how to screen your studies!

It’s time to move on to the next step of conducting a systematic review: <a href = "http://evsynthacademy.org/extract-data/">Extract Your Data</a>.
